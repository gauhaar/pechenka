### 2. PLATFORM DESCRIPTION AND OPERATING PRINCIPLES

**2.1 Architectural Principle: Local Processing**

Sithub is designed based on the principle of **"Privacy by Design"** (privacy by design). All Components operate exclusively on the User's local infrastructure without transferring source code to external servers.

**2.2 Platform Components**

**2.2.1 Repository Management System**

Self-hosted Git version control:

- Operates entirely on the User's equipment
- Does not require internet connection for core functionality
- Does not transmit repository data to Provider's servers
- Is a fully autonomous component for code management

**2.2.2 Security Scanning Engine**

AI-powered code analysis operating locally:

- Performs security scanning on local infrastructure
- Runs entirely within your network
- Integrates with locally stored vulnerability databases
- Does not transmit code or scan results externally
- Provides real-time vulnerability detection

**2.2.3 Vulnerability Database Service**

Security intelligence updates:

- Downloads threat data from Provider's servers
- Stores databases locally on your infrastructure
- **The only component** that communicates with Provider's servers
- Receives regular security updates (see section 2.3)

**2.3 Security Update Service**

**2.3.1 Purpose of Service**

Sithub uses vulnerability databases to scan User's code for known security threats. To ensure these databases are up-to-date, the Platform downloads updates from Provider's servers.

**2.3.2 What is Transmitted FROM Provider's Servers TO User**

**Incoming data flow** (from Provider's servers to User's infrastructure):

- Vulnerability databases (CVE, information about malicious packages)
- Security patches and vulnerability remediation instructions
- Package security metadata (npm, PyPI, Maven, etc.)
- Malicious code signatures
- Security scanning engine updates

**2.3.3 What is Transmitted FROM User TO Provider's Servers**

**Outgoing data flow** (from User's infrastructure to Provider's servers):

- **License verification tokens** - cryptographic tokens to confirm subscription validity
- **License key hash** - for authenticating update requests
- **Update request metadata:**
  - Request timestamp
  - Installed Sithub version
  - Installation identifier hash (irreversible)

**CRITICALLY IMPORTANT:**

- **User's Source Code is NEVER transmitted to Provider's servers**
- **Security scan results are NEVER transmitted to Provider's servers**
- **File names, project structure, repository metadata are NEVER transmitted**
- **Information about developers and users is NEVER transmitted**

**2.3.4 Technical Implementation of Code Isolation Guarantee**

Sithub architecture ensures structural impossibility of source code transmission:

- Scanning module operates in an isolated process without network access
- Update module has access only to the database directory
- Network module is implemented on "write-only" principle for updates (download only, no data upload)
- Absence of API methods for transmitting source code to external servers

### 1. INTRODUCTION AND PRINCIPLES

**1.1 Purpose of this Policy**

This Privacy Policy (hereinafter referred to as the "Policy") describes the principles and practices of data processing when using the Sithub platform. The Policy is an integral part of the Terms of Service and should be read in conjunction with them.

**1.2 Privacy by Design Principle**

Sithub is built on the architectural principle of data collection minimization. Privacy is not an additional feature—it is a fundamental characteristic of the system architecture.

**1.3 Applicable Legislation**

This Policy has been developed taking into account:

- The Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan "On Personal Data and Their Protection"
- The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)—for users from the European Union
- Other applicable data protection regulations in the User's jurisdiction

**1.4 Data Controller and Processor**

**For personal data processed in connection with subscriptions:**

- **Data Controller:** Silence AI
- We determine the purposes and means of processing subscription information

**For data processed on the Platform:**

- **Data Controller:** User (you control your code and development data)
- **Data Processor:** Not applicable—we do not process your development data

---

### 2. ARCHITECTURAL PRIVACY GUARANTEES

**2.1 Core Principle of Data Isolation**

User source code is processed exclusively on the User's local infrastructure. The Sithub architecture is designed to prevent the transmission of source code to the Provider's servers.

**2.2 Technical Implementation of Isolation**

**Repository Management:**

- Operates completely on your infrastructure
- Contains no network data transmission functions for code
- All repositories stored locally

**Security Scanning:**

- Operates completely on your infrastructure
- Vulnerability detection runs locally
- Scan results remain on your servers
- No code fragments transmitted externally

**Update Service:**

- The only component that communicates with the Provider's servers
- Transmits only the data specified in section 3.2
- Downloads vulnerability databases to your infrastructure
- The scanning module is isolated from network functions

**2.3 What This Means in Practice**

The Provider has no technical ability to access:

- Source code stored on the Platform
- Security scan results
- Commit history and code changes
- File names and project structure
- Repository metadata

**Important Clarification:** This guarantee is valid provided Sithub is operated correctly in accordance with the technical documentation and in the absence of User actions to manually transmit data to external services.

2. PLATFORM DESCRIPTION AND OPERATING PRINCIPLES

2.1 Architectural Principle: Local Processing
Sithub is designed based on the principle of "Privacy by Design". All Components operate exclusively on the User's local infrastructure without transferring source code to external servers.

2.2 Platform Components

2.2.1 Repository Management System
Self-hosted Git version control:
· Operates entirely on the User's equipment
· Does not require internet connection for core functionality
· Does not transmit repository data to Provider's servers
· Is a fully autonomous component for code management

2.2.2 Security Scanning Engine
AI-powered code analysis operating locally:
· Performs security scanning on local infrastructure
· Runs entirely within your network
· Integrates with locally stored vulnerability databases
· Does not transmit code or scan results externally
· Provides real-time vulnerability detection

2.2.3 Vulnerability Database Service
Security intelligence updates:
· Downloads threat data from Provider's servers
· Stores databases locally on your infrastructure
· The only component that communicates with Provider's servers
· Receives regular security updates (see section 2.3)

2.3 Security Update Service

2.3.1 Purpose of Service
Sithub uses vulnerability databases to scan User's code for known security threats. To ensure these databases are up-to-date, the Platform downloads updates from Provider's servers.

2.3.2 What is Transmitted FROM Provider's Servers TO User
Incoming data flow:
· Vulnerability databases (CVE, malicious packages, etc.)
· Security patches and remediation instructions
· Package security metadata (npm, PyPI, Maven, etc.)
· Malicious code signatures
· Scanning engine updates

2.3.3 What is Transmitted FROM User TO Provider's Servers
Outgoing data flow:
· License verification tokens - cryptographic tokens to confirm subscription validity
· License key hash - for authenticating update requests
· Update request metadata:
  · Request timestamp
  · Installed Sithub version
  · Installation identifier hash (irreversible)

CRITICALLY IMPORTANT:
· User's Source Code is NEVER transmitted to Provider's servers
· Security scan results are NEVER transmitted
· File names, project structure, repository metadata are NEVER transmitted
· Information about developers and users is NEVER transmitted

2.3.4 Technical Implementation of Code Isolation Guarantee
Sithub architecture ensures structural impossibility of source code transmission:
· Scanning module operates in an isolated process without network access
· Update module has access only to the database directory
· Network module is implemented on "write-only" principle (download only)
· Absence of API methods for transmitting source code externally

3. DATA SECURITY GUARANTEES AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS
