              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Service Description and Performance</h2>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>3.1 Core Service:</strong> Supreme is a lightweight code vulnerability scanner extension for Visual Studio Code that performs local analysis of source code on your machine for security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and exposed secrets. All code analysis is performed locally within the VSCode environment on your personal computer.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>3.2 Local Analysis Guarantee:</strong> All code scanning, analysis, and detection occurs entirely on your local machine. Your source code is never uploaded to, transmitted to, stored on, or processed by Supreme's servers or any third-party infrastructure. This is the fundamental architecture of Supreme and a core guarantee to our users.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>3.3 Vulnerability Database:</strong> Supreme utilizes a vulnerability and misconfiguration database (the "Database") containing known security patterns, vulnerability signatures, and configuration issues. The Database is downloaded to and stored locally on your machine. The Database is updated periodically at our discretion. Access to updated Databases requires an active paid subscription.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>3.4 Server Communication:</strong> Supreme communicates with our servers only in the following two scenarios: To download updated Databases when you explicitly request a Database refresh and to verify your subscription license status before permitting Database updates. No other communication between the extension and our servers occurs. Your source code is never transmitted during these interactions. Only technical metadata (extension version, license key, request timestamp) is transmitted for license verification and Database management purposes.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>3.5 Free vs. Paid Functionality:</strong> Supreme functions without a paid subscription using a default Database. However, users without an active subscription will not receive updated Databases containing the latest vulnerability signatures and security patterns, which may result in missed detections during code analysis.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>3.6 Performance Warranty:</strong> We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that Supreme functions substantially in accordance with its documented behavior. If Supreme fails to perform its core local analysis function, we will, at our expense, use reasonable efforts to correct the issue. If we fail to correct a material non-conformity, your sole remedy shall be to terminate your subscription and receive a refund of any prepaid subscription fees for the unused portion of your subscription term.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>3.7 Service Disclaimers:</strong> You acknowledge and agree that: Supreme is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. Vulnerability detection by any tool, including Supreme, is not exhaustive or guaranteed. Absence of a detected vulnerability does not mean your code is secure. Supreme may not identify all vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or secrets in your code. False positives and false negatives may occur. You remain solely responsible for conducting additional security testing and code review. Supreme is not a substitute for professional security audits or penetration testing.</p>

            <section id="subscription">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Subscription and Licensing</h2>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>4.1 Subscription Terms:</strong> Your subscription to Supreme grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the extension and access updated Databases during the subscription term. Subscriptions are offered on a monthly or annual basis as specified on our pricing page.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>4.2 License Key Confidentiality:</strong> If you activate a paid subscription, you receive a license key. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your license key. All usage and actions associated with your license key are your responsibility. You may not share, distribute, or sublicense your license key to other parties.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>4.3 Subscription Fees:</strong> You agree to pay the subscription fees according to the billing frequency you selected. Subscription fees are: Non-refundable and non-cancellable. Exclusive of applicable taxes and duties. Subject to change with 30 days' notice via email or our website. Price changes apply to new billing cycles after the notification period.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>4.4 License Verification and Database Access:</strong> When you attempt to download an updated Database, your license status will be verified against our servers. If your subscription is active, the Database download will proceed. If your subscription is inactive, expired, or you fail to pay subscription fees, Database downloads will be restricted.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>4.5 Late Payment:</strong> If subscription fees remain unpaid after notification of default, we may disable your access to Database downloads and updated Databases until payment is received. Late payment does not eliminate your obligation to pay all amounts due.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>4.6 Billing and Payment:</strong> We will bill your payment card on a monthly or annual basis as agreed. You authorize us and our payment processor to bill your card automatically. If payment fails, you remain responsible for all amounts due. We reserve the right to pursue payment through legal means if necessary.</p>
