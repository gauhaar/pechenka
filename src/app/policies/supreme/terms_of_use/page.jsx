              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. About These Terms</h2>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>1.1 Agreement Scope:</strong> These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Supreme extension for Visual Studio Code and related services provided by Silence AI LLC ("we," "us," "our," or "Company"). These Terms apply to you, the individual or entity accessing our services ("you" or "your"), and your employer or principal if you are acting on their behalf.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>1.2 Authority and Acceptance:</strong> If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms. By installing, accessing, or using Supreme, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must uninstall the extension and discontinue use immediately.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="service-description">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Service Description</h2>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>2.1 Core Functionality:</strong> Supreme is a lightweight code vulnerability scanner extension for Visual Studio Code that analyzes source code locally on your machine for security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and exposed secrets. The extension performs all code analysis on your local development environment without transmitting your code to external servers.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>2.2 Local Code Analysis:</strong> All code scanning and analysis is performed on your computer within the VSCode environment. Your source code remains solely under your control and is never uploaded to, processed by, or stored on Supreme's servers or any third-party infrastructure. This is the core architecture of Supreme and represents a fundamental guarantee to our users.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>2.3 Vulnerability Database:</strong> Supreme operates using a vulnerability and misconfiguration database (the "Database"). The Database is stored locally on your machine after download. You may use Supreme with a default Database, or activate a paid subscription to access updated Databases containing the latest vulnerability signatures and security patterns.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>2.4 Server Interaction:</strong> Supreme connects to our servers in exactly two scenarios: To download updated Databases when you request a refresh and to verify your license status before permitting Database updates. No other communication between the extension and our servers occurs. Your source code is never transmitted during these interactions.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>2.5 Functionality Without Subscription:</strong> Supreme functions without a paid subscription using a default Database. However, users without an active subscription will not receive the latest vulnerability updates and security patterns, which may result in missed detections during code analysis.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="user-responsibilities">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use</h2>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>3.1 License Credentials:</strong> If you activate a paid subscription, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your license key and subscription credentials. All usage associated with your license key is your responsibility.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>3.2 Lawful Use:</strong> You agree to use Supreme only for lawful purposes and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>3.3 Authorized Code Analysis:</strong> You agree to analyze only source code for which you have ownership or explicit authorization from the code owner. You may not use Supreme to analyze code belonging to third parties without their written consent.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>3.4 Prohibited Activities:</strong> You agree not to: Use Supreme to analyze code you do not own or have explicit permission to analyze. Attempt to interfere with the proper functioning of the extension or its license verification mechanisms. Share, distribute, or resell your license key to unauthorized third parties. Use automated tools to bypass license verification or Database download restrictions. Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive the source code or proprietary algorithms of Supreme. Use Supreme for competitive analysis or to develop competing products. Engage in any activity that could harm Supreme's infrastructure, servers, or other users.</p>

              <p className="mb-4"><strong>4.2 Pricing Changes:</strong> We reserve the right to modify pricing at any time. Price changes will be communicated on our website with reasonable notice and will take effect for new billing cycles after the notification period. Continued use of Supreme after a price change constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>4.3 License Verification:</strong> When you attempt to download an updated Database, your license status will be verified against our servers. If your subscription is active, the Database download will proceed. If your subscription is inactive or expired, Database download will be restricted.</p>
              <p className="mb-4"><strong>4.4 No Refunds for Updates:</strong> Updates and refreshes to the Database are included as part of your subscription. We do not provide refunds for Database refreshes or updates that are part of your active subscription period.</p>

This information is used solely for license verification and Database management. Your source code is never transmitted during these communications.</p>

              <p className="mb-4"><strong>6.2 Your Code:</strong> You retain full ownership of all source code and content you analyze using Supreme.
